# 01_Neural_Network_Regression_with_TensorFlow_Exercises

In this exercise I did the following:

- Created a dummy regression dataset and modelled a neural network to it.
- Conducted multiple experiments to improve the model results.
- Imported the Boston pricing dataset from TensorFlow tf.keras.datasets and modelled it.
